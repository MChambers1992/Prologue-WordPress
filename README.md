# Prologue WordPress Theme
A WordPress port of the Prologue web template originally developed by https://html5up.net/ all original template features aren't present in the port such as css icons in the navigation, this is due to an issue with the WordPress menu system.

# Style
The theme keeps as close to the original as possible which is browsable here; https://html5up.net/uploads/demos/prologue/ With some very minor alterations, an example of the theme is below.
